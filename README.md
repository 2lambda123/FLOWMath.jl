*A collection of mathematical functions and convenience methods*.  These are simple methods we use regularly in our lab that aren't readily available in the Julia ecosystem.  

Quadrature
- trapezoidal integration

Root Finding
- Brent's method

Interpolation
- Akima spline
- 2D/3D/4D interpolation from recursive 1D iterpolation

Smoothing
- absolute value
- Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser constraint aggregation function
- sigmoid blending
- cubic/quintic polynomial blending
